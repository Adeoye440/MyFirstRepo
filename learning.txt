What i have learned from this course  how to use Git and GitHub for version control. I now understand how to create repositories, commit changes, work with branches, and collaborate with others using pull requests. Using the ALX Sandbox has also helped me practice these commands in a real development environment, improving my workflow and confidence in version control.
